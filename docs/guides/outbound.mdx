## Overview

Outbound queues automate proactive outreach — sending messages to contacts on a schedule, tracking responses, and managing follow-ups through a pipeline.

## Create a Queue

```bash
ravi outbound create "Prospecting" \
  --instructions "You are a sales agent. Reach out to this lead, introduce our product, and gauge interest." \
  --every 5m \
  --stages '[{"name":"cold"},{"name":"engaged","delay":30},{"name":"meeting_booked","delay":1440},{"name":"proposal","delay":4320},{"name":"closed"},{"name":"lost"}]' \
  --agent main \
  --active-start 09:00 \
  --active-end 22:00 \
  --tz America/Sao_Paulo \
  --max-rounds 3
```

### Required options

- `--instructions` — Prompt the agent receives when processing each entry
- `--every` — Interval between processing entries (e.g., `5m`, `1h`)
- `--stages` — Pipeline stages as JSON array

### Pipeline Stages

Each queue defines its own pipeline. The `delay` field (in minutes) controls how long to wait before automatic follow-up at that stage:

```json
[
  { "name": "cold" },
  { "name": "engaged", "delay": 30 },
  { "name": "meeting_booked", "delay": 1440 },
  { "name": "proposal", "delay": 4320 },
  { "name": "closed" },
  { "name": "lost" }
]
```

Stages without `delay` don't trigger automatic follow-ups.

### Stage Examples

**B2B Sales:**
```json
[{"name":"cold"},{"name":"engaged","delay":30},{"name":"meeting_booked","delay":1440},{"name":"proposal","delay":4320},{"name":"closed"},{"name":"lost"}]
```

**Recruiting:**
```json
[{"name":"new"},{"name":"replied","delay":30},{"name":"interested","delay":60},{"name":"interview_scheduled","delay":1440},{"name":"hired"},{"name":"declined"}]
```

**Collections:**
```json
[{"name":"notice"},{"name":"reminder","delay":1440},{"name":"urgent","delay":2880},{"name":"final_notice","delay":4320},{"name":"defaulted"}]
```

## Add Contacts

### Individual entries

```bash
ravi outbound add <queueId> 5511999999999 --name "João Silva"
ravi outbound add <queueId> 5511888888888 --name "Maria" --context '{"company":"Acme","role":"CTO"}'
```

### Bulk by tag

```bash
ravi outbound add <queueId> - --tag leads
```

## Activate the Queue

```bash
ravi outbound start <queueId>
```

## Processing Priority

Each processing cycle handles entries in this order:

1. **Response entries** — Contacts who replied (event-driven, highest priority)
2. **Follow-up entries** — Contacted but no response, based on stage delay and max rounds
3. **Initial outreach** — New pending entries at round 0 (timer-driven)

## Agent Workflow

During outbound sessions, the agent receives:

- **System context** (invisible to contact): Queue instructions, available pipeline stages, CLI actions, entry metadata
- **User prompt** (visible): Contact info for initial outreach, response text for follow-ups, or elapsed time for no-response follow-ups

The agent can use these tools during the session:

```bash
# Send a message (with humanized delivery)
ravi outbound send <entryId> "Hello João! I wanted to reach out about..." --typing-delay 3000 --pause 1000

# Qualify/advance the lead
ravi outbound qualify <entryId> engaged

# Add context notes
ravi outbound context <entryId> '{"note":"Interested in enterprise plan"}'

# Mark as done
ravi outbound done <entryId>

# Skip entry
ravi outbound skip <entryId>
```

## Humanized Delivery

Outbound sends simulate natural human behavior:

- `--typing-delay <ms>` — Show typing indicator before sending
- `--pause <ms>` — Pause before typing (simulates reading time)

Sentinel-mode agents automatically get humanized timing based on message length (3-5s pause + 2-8s typing).

## Monitor Progress

```bash
# Queue overview
ravi outbound show <queueId>

# List entries with status
ravi outbound entries <queueId>

# Entry details
ravi outbound status <entryId>

# Chat history
ravi outbound chat <entryId>
ravi outbound chat <entryId> --limit 10

# Full report
ravi outbound report              # All queues
ravi outbound report <queueId>    # Specific queue
```

## Manage Entries

```bash
# Reset entry to pending (try again)
ravi outbound reset <entryId>
ravi outbound reset <entryId> --full   # Also clears context

# Manually trigger queue
ravi outbound run <queueId>

# Pause queue
ravi outbound pause <queueId>

# Delete queue
ravi outbound rm <queueId>
```

## Session Isolation

Each entry runs in its own isolated session:

```
agent:{agentId}:outbound:{queueId}:{phone}
```

This ensures conversation context is maintained per-contact without cross-contamination.

## Active Hours

Queues respect active hours and timezone:

```bash
ravi outbound set <queueId> active-start 09:00
ravi outbound set <queueId> active-end 22:00
ravi outbound set <queueId> tz America/Sao_Paulo
```

Processing is paused outside active hours.

## Queue Completion

When all entries reach `done` or `skipped` status, the queue automatically transitions to `completed`.

## Entry Statuses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `pending` | Waiting to be processed |
| `active` | Currently being processed |
| `done` | Completed successfully |
| `skipped` | Manually skipped |
| `error` | Failed during processing |
